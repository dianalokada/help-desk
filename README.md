This project is a basic “help desk” / support system ticket management system.

On the main page of the app, end users of the service should be able to submit support ticket
requests. Necessary fields include name, email and a description of the problem they are
experiencing.

On a separate page, the backend admin panel, support staff should be able to see a list
summary of each ticket, including status. They should be able to drill down into the ticket and
respond to a request, as well as update the status of the ticket. Possible statuses are “new”, “in
progress”, and “resolved”.

The front-end UI is implemented using Next.js/React/Java Script, with the backend in Node/Express.
